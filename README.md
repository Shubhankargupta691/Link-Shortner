# Link-Shortner

A link shortener is a web application that takes a long URL and generates a shorter, more user-friendly URL that redirects to the original URL. 
This can be useful for sharing links on social media or in other contexts where space is limited. In Python, a link shortener can be implemented using a web framework like Flask or Django. 
The basic workflow involves creating a route that handles incoming requests to the short URL, and another route that generates a new short URL when a user submits a long URL. To generate the short URL, the program can use a hashing algorithm like SHA-256 to generate a unique identifier for the URL. 
The identifier can then be stored in a database along with the original URL. When a user visits the short URL, the program looks up the identifier in the database and redirects the user to the original URL. This implementation can be extended to include features like analytics to track clicks and referrers, and to prevent abuse by rate-limiting or requiring authentication.
