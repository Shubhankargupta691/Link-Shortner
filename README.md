# Link-Shortner

A link shortener is a web application that takes a long URL and generates a shorter, more user-friendly URL that redirects to the original URL. 
This can be useful for sharing links on social media or in other contexts where space is limited. In Python, a link shortener can be implemented using a web framework like Flask or Django. 
The basic workflow involves creating a route that handles incoming requests to the short URL, and another route that generates a new short URL when a user submits a long URL. To generate the short URL, the program can use a hashing algorithm like SHA-256 to generate a unique identifier for the URL.
